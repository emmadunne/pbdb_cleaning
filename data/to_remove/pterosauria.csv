Most of the bones lie at the bottom of this unit, whereas the fossil plants are distributed throughout the bed. This unit is underlain by beds of red, purple, and green-hued carbonate, mudstone, fine sandstone, and siltstone. The base of the fossil-bearing unit is incised into the underlying carbonate unit, or even into the oxidized, muddy siltstone beneath the carbonate unit. Bones are often incorporated within lenses of conglomerate consisting of subrounded to rounded carbonate pebbles. Kirkland and Carpenter (1994) interpreted the carbonate pebbles to be transported calcareous soil nodules, but they may be rip-up clasts from the carbonate unit that underlies the fossil bearing unit in some areas.\r\n The fossiliferous unit is overlain by a bed of resistant, fine-grained volcanic tuff which is well cemented and tends to break perpendicular to the bedding. It was from this tuff that one nearly complete articulated fish, and parts of several others, were recovered (see Kirkland, this volume).\r\nThe presence of a laterally continuous carbonate bed below the quarry, and two laterally continuous tuff units above, indicates that the tuffs were deposited in a predominantly lacustrine environment. Based on the lateral extent of the tuffs, it is estimated that the lake was at least 1.5 km wide. The occurrence of articulated fish in the lower tuff unit indicates deposition in quiet water, although the presence of ripple marks suggest that the water was relatively shallow at times. The fact that fossil root casts are present in the tuff to the southwest and east of Rabbit Valley, but absent in the area of the quarry, implies that the lake level receded temporarily, although water remained in the area of the quarry.

Immediately below the specimen, the sediment shows conspicuous bioturbation. The sediment encasing the pterosaur is a dark grey limestone. The sedimentary unit (12 cm thick) including the fossil can be divided into three main parts (Fig. 4): 1) Basal most part (3 cm thick): a micritic limestone with less fossil shells than seen elsewhere; the base is erosional with scour-and-fill-structures; 2) Middle part (5 cm): the matrix is micritic and contains many ooids, and shells (mostly convex side up) and shell fragments; lamellibranchs with both shells preserved are rare; the ooids often have fragments of bivalves and gastropods as nuclei; towards the upper part the\r\nooids show a decrease in grain size, indicating a small scale fining upward sequence; 3) Upper part (4 cm): this micritic part is the matrix of the pterosaur, it shows marly laminated intercalations; the ooid content decreases gradually, they are missing in the uppermost part; the last part of the slab is built up by laminated, yellow, calcareous marl; the latter yields thin shell\r\nfragments and rare ganoid scales. The layer above the specimen is of a 1 cm thick grey clay followed by a 28 cm thick finely laminated grey limestone.

The ooids from the middle part come from such an environment but were transported and redeposited by a storm. The normal graded bedding, the convex up/down position of the shells and the frequent telescoping\r\nposition support this. The layer including the pterosaur is interpreted as a storm deposit, a tempestite that was subsequently bioturbated (presence of Thalassinoides). The increased marl content, the complete absence of ooids in the uppermost part and the clay layer indicate laminar, non-turbulent lower energy conditions. The thin layer of grey clay can be interpreted as a fine deposition during a quiet sedimentation period.

However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

However, several workers noticed the similarity of Kota fishes with the European Toarcian fishes (Schaeffer and Patterson 1984). Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

Skeletons are embedded laterally, sometimes in dorsoventral position. Many skeletons of our collection are fully articulated, and disarticulated skeletal elements of fishes and other vertebrates appear to be a result of decay during post-mortem floating. At present there is no evidence for major current transport on the sea floor. Most vertebrate fossils are compressed, as a consequence of the compaction of the sediment. Some specimens are preserved in 3D, although flattened. In several of these specimens, geopetal collapse is observed. In general, compressed specimens are embedded parallel to the lamination. Delicate morphological elements (e.g., fin rays, gill rakers and filaments) of some specimens are obliquely embedded, indicating that the sediment must have been soft. According to microprobe analysis, bones are frequently preserved as fluorapatite. Phosphatization of soft parts such as intestinal contents, myotomes, gill laments, cycloid scales and ns of shes, is observed occasionally and indicates that replacement of organic tissues by uorapatite occurred at a very early stage of diagenetic mineralization, preceding or accompanying microbial decay, and often prior to sediment compaction. This process of a very early and almost instantaneous phosphatization has been described as a medusa effect by Martill (1993a).""\r\n\r\nInvertebrates: Ammonoids are preserved as compressed internal moulds. Most are embedded laterally in the sediment, but occasional diagonally or vertically embedded specimens also occur and suggest the presence of soft or soupy sediment. Aptychi are mostly found isolated; in rare cases, they still rest in the living chamber. Our collection also includes specimens with a phosphatic preservation of the sipho, either complete or with different degrees of fragmentation. Most inoceramids still preserve their thick prismatic shells, although the aragonitic layer is always recrystallized. In a few specimens, the shell is replaced by goethite indicating very early diagenetic replacement of the periostracum by pyrite. Most inoceramid shells are closed, although separated valves, fragmented shells, or rarely shell hash also occur. Calcitic shells such as oysters, ammonoid aptychi, or foraminiferal tests, are preserved with minor recrystallization. Phosphatization of the invertebrate fossils has been recognized in rare occasions, for instance in decapod crustacean carapaces or ammonite siphos."" \r\n\r\n ",general faunal/floral,,,,,,,,,,marine,,actively mobile,volant,,piscivore,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,,Muzquizopteryx,n. gen.,,,coahuilensis,n. sp.,R.

The Reptile Bed was referred to the Lower Shales of Barrow's local succession in the Great Estuarine Series.

Hudson (1962a) published a general account of the stratigraphy of the Great Estuarine Series which showed that its age is Upper Bajocian and Bathonian.

Skeletons are embedded laterally, sometimes in dorsoventral position. Many skeletons of our collection are fully articulated, and disarticulated skeletal elements of fishes and other vertebrates appear to be a result of decay during post-mortem floating. At present there is no evidence for major current transport on the sea floor. Most vertebrate fossils are compressed, as a consequence of the compaction of the sediment. Some specimens are preserved in 3D, although flattened. In several of these specimens, geopetal collapse is observed. In general, compressed specimens are embedded parallel to the lamination. Delicate morphological elements (e.g., fin rays, gill rakers and filaments) of some specimens are obliquely embedded, indicating that the sediment must have been soft. According to microprobe analysis, bones are frequently preserved as fluorapatite. Phosphatization of soft parts such as intestinal contents, myotomes, gill laments, cycloid scales and ns of shes, is observed occasionally and indicates that replacement of organic tissues by uorapatite occurred at a very early stage of diagenetic mineralization, preceding or accompanying microbial decay, and often prior to sediment compaction. This process of a very early and almost instantaneous phosphatization has been described as a medusa effect by Martill (1993a).""\r\n\r\nInvertebrates: Ammonoids are preserved as compressed internal moulds. Most are embedded laterally in the sediment, but occasional diagonally or vertically embedded specimens also occur and suggest the presence of soft or soupy sediment. Aptychi are mostly found isolated; in rare cases, they still rest in the living chamber. Our collection also includes specimens with a phosphatic preservation of the sipho, either complete or with different degrees of fragmentation. Most inoceramids still preserve their thick prismatic shells, although the aragonitic layer is always recrystallized. In a few specimens, the shell is replaced by goethite indicating very early diagenetic replacement of the periostracum by pyrite. Most inoceramid shells are closed, although separated valves, fragmented shells, or rarely shell hash also occur. Calcitic shells such as oysters, ammonoid aptychi, or foraminiferal tests, are preserved with minor recrystallization.

The SMNK was initially told that the pterosaur originated from a quarry at Hâqel, although doubts were raised during discussions with another local dealer. We were later informed that this fossil had probably not been removed from the quarry of Hâqel but was likely from the nearby locality of Hjoûla (Roy Nohra, personal communication). As Hjoûla is only ~4 km south of Hâqel it is conceivable that the fossil dealers and middle men were uncertain as to the specimen’s exact provenance. The sediments of Hâqel, however, contain a moderate amount of bioclasts and are noticeably whiter in colouration than those of Hjoûla, which are more micritic. A comparison of the grey limestone slab with other specimens housed at the SMNK leads us to propose the Early Cenomanian locality of Hjoûla as the true provenance of this specimen.

The Griman Creek Formation is composed of thinly laminated and interbedded fine- to medium-grained sandstones, siltstones and mudstones, with carbonate cements, intraformational conglomerate beds and coal deposits (Burger, 1980; Green et al., 1997). Within the Griman Creek Formation, opal and fossils occur within interbedded siltstone and mudstone layers, often referred to as the Finch clay facies (Byrnes, 1977). Palynological evidence indicates that the Griman Creek Formation is associated with the Coptospora paradoxa Zone and correlates to the middle Albian (Burger, 1980).

An early Cenomanian age for deposition of the Cambridge Greensand is based on an apparently autochthonous foraminiferan assemblage, but Morter and Wood (1983) could not rule out the possibility of a very late Albian age due to the presence of the bivalve Aucinella. The age of the derived vertebrates is now considered to be no older than the Callihoplites auritus ammonite subzone and most likely no younger than upper Stoliczkaia dispar Zone, and they are thus of late Albian age.""
